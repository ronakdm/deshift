Deshift
==============

This library is built to perform distributionally robust optimization (DRO) within existing PyTorch workflows with a single additional line of code.
The focus is on spectral risk measure-based learning which is described in detail in `this AISTATS 2023 paper <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/mehta23b.html>`_
and `this ICLR 2024 paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13863>`_ (Spotlight Presentation). Distributionally robust objectives apply a sample reweighting to the 
observerd training data within each mini-batch inorder to robustify models against distribution shifts that occur at test time. The main features are:

* Implementations of the superquantile/conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), extremile, and exponential spectral risk measures.
* Implementations of the pool adjacent violators (PAV) algorithm for computing regularized spectral risk measures with Kullback-Leibler and Chi-Squared divergences.

The main idea of the method is to define a **spectrum**, which governs the most skewed distribution the user expects on the test distribution (as compared to the uniform distribution of the training data observed at train time).
Here are various examples of common spectra observed in the literature:

Installation
------------------

Once you have installed PyTorch >=1.6. (see `instructions <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_), you can install Deshift by running

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:ronakdm/drtorch.git
    $ cd deshift
    $ pip install -e .

Quickstart
------------------

First, we construct a function that inputs a vector of losses and returns a probability distribution over elements in this loss vector.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from deshift import make_spectral_risk_measure, make_superquantile_spectrum
  >>> spectrum = make_superquantile_spectrum(batch_size, 2.0)
  >>> compute_sample_weight = make_spectral_risk_measure(spectrum, penalty="chi2", shift_cost=1.0)

Assume that we have computed a vector of losses based on a model output in PyTorch. We can then use the function above and back propagate through the weighted sum of losses.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> x, y = get_batch()
  >>> logits = model(x)
  >>> losses = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(logits, y, reduction="none")
  >>> with torch.no_grad():
  >>>     weights = compute_sample_weight(losses.cpu().numpy()).to(device)
  >>> loss = weights @ losses
  >>> loss.backward()

A detailed quickstart guide is given in `docs/source/quicstart.ipynb`, whereas an example training on Fashion MNIST is given in `examples/train_fashion_mnist.ipynb`.
